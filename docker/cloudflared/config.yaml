# docker/cloudflare/config.yaml
# Replace <YOUR_TUNNEL_UUID> with the actual ID from the Cloudflare dashboard.
tunnel: ${CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_UUID}

# Defines how traffic for public hostnames should be routed to your internal services.
ingress:
  # 1. Access to the MySQL database (Arbitrary TCP)
  # This is for your local machine connection (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
  - hostname: mysql.spotacus.app
    service: tcp://mysql:3306  # 'mysql' is the Docker Compose service name

  # 2. Access to your Nginx web server (HTTP/HTTPS)
  # This is for public/web app access.
#   - hostname: app.spotacus.app
    # service: http://nginx

  # 3. Catch-all rule (must be the last rule)
  # All other traffic to the tunnel's IP/hostname will result in a 404 error.
